Cybersecurity 

Welcome!  
I am a Computing student focused on **Cybersecurity**.  
This repository centralizes my academic and personal projects, showing hands-on labs and practical skills.  

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Labs
- [Linux Virtual Network Lab]()  
  Configured Apache, SSH, Samba, DHCP on Ubuntu; analyzed plaintext vs encrypted traffic with Wireshark; applied firewall rules (UFW/iptables).  

- [Firewall Lab]()  
  Set up Ubuntu firewall with UFW; tested service accessibility using Nmap scans.  

- *(Next)* Fail2Ban SSH Protection → Implement brute-force prevention with automated blocking and log analysis.
